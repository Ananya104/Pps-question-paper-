A compiler is a software that converts  a program written in high level language to machine language , that can be understood by the computer.It takes a program as a whole and translates it. Examples of compiler include C, C++ and Java.  
Data types specify how we enter data into our program and what type of data we enter. C language has some predefined set of data types to handle various kinds of data that we can use in our program. These data types are divided into two parts a) Derived data types and b) Primary data types. Primary data types are the fundamental data types that include integer (int), floating point (float), character (char) and void. 
Break statement is used to terminate a loop or to exit a switch statement. Syntax of break statement is given as-  break;
Printf is used to print values onto the output screen. To use this, we need to include <stdio.h> header file using #include <stdio.h> statement. As a result, it prints strings included inside quotations. 
For loop is a loop used to check for certain conditions and repeatedly execute a block of code as long as those conditions are met. Syntax of for loop is given as -   For (initial value;condition;incrementation or decrementation) {statement;} 
An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements.These elements are of the same data type. Syntax of an Array is given as-  data type  array name  [array size] .For example float mark [5] is an array that can hold 5 floating point values.
